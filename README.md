This is an expo React Native project which is a template for authentication with Facebook and BE service at the same time.
It gets a short term access token from facebook and exchanges it with the backend for JWT token, which is later used for authenticating the user.

JWT token is stored in a secure storage which is then re-verified on each app open.
